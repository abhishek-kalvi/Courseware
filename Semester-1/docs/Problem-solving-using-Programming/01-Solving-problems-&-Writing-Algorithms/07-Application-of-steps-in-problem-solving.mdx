💭 :thought_balloon: **What is the need for problem solving skills?**

  

When you tackle problems on your own, or in a group, you become resilient. You learn to look at challenges from a fresh perspective. The root objective or the most basic objective of problem solving is to make everyday mundane life easy.

  

Problem-solving enables one to identify and exploit opportunities in the environment and exert (some level of) control over the future. Problem solving skills and the problem-solving process are a critical part of daily life for both individuals as well as organisations.

Problem solving provides a radically new way of approaching and solving problems in general.

## Importance of Problem Solving

Good problem solving skills help to portray that you have a range of competencies such as logic, creativity, resilience, imagination, lateral thinking and determination.

It is indeed a vital skill for your professional and personal life.

  

While we often think about these skills in the work context, problem solving isn’t just helpful in the workplace. Let's take a look at a few applications of problem solving in everyday life to better understand the concept and how it can make tasks easier for you in the future.

  

### Let’s look at few different scenarios and do some brainstorming

**Scenario 1:** Tim is responsible for giving a bonus to factory workers that have perfect attendance during the month. One worker missed one day due to a death in the family. The worker has an emotional outburst in Tim’s office and tells Tim that she needs the bonus desperately since she is behind on her rent. The rules are clear and the bonus is for perfect attendance period no if, buts, or maybes. However, Tim does have the authority to make exceptions to the rule. What should Tim do?

**Scenario 3:** Rahul shares an office with two other co-workers.One of them, Sameer, often likes to talk about his family and personal life. However, his other co-worker Gaurav thinks the workplace is strictly for work and not a place to vent. Rahul finds Sameer’s monologues amusing but is aware that Gaurav is getting angrier by the second. Sameer has also started noticing that Gaurav is disinterested since he stares at the computer and ignores him when he talks which Sameer finds rude and disrespectful. Rahul thinks that sooner or later Sameer and Gaurav are going to have an altercation which might increase the negativity in the workplace. What should Rahul do?
